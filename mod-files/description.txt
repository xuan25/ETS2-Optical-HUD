# Optical-HUD

The Optical-HUD mod introduces a virtual Head-Up Display (HUD) designed with a screen size of 2000 x 1250 mm (92.9 inches) and a virtual image distance (VID) of 10 meters. This setup is particularly beneficial for VR players as it eliminates the need to frequently refocus their eyes, reducing eye fatigue and enhancing comfort during extended gameplay.
